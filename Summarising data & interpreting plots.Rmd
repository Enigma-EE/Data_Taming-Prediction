# Categorical data: tables and bar charts


## the appropriate way to summarise categorical variable is tables and bar charts.

Looking at the MPG dataset, the columns containing characters (<chr>) are categorical variables. Let’s take the first column, the manufacturer. How many of each brand of car are there?

```{r tables_m}
table(mpg$manufacturer)
```

## the proportion of each type of car

```{r prop_m}
prop.table(table(mpg$manufacturer))
```

## represent this information as a bar chart

```{r bar_plot_m}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x = manufacturer)) + geom_bar()
```

this command is telling R to:

1. make a canvas which will visualise data from the mpg dataframe (ggplot(mpg));
1. map the single aesthetic  manufacturer to the x-axis of this canvas(aes(manufacturer));
1. and then add a bar chart layer showing this to the plot (+ geom_bar()).


# Quantitative Variables: Location, Spread and Histograms

quantitative variables - describe the centre and spread of the data
For continuous variables - the mean and standard deviation.

Picking the column displ - which records the mean engine displacement in litres

```{r mean_sd}
mean(mpg$displ)
sd(mpg$displ)
```

Statisticians often talk about the 'five-number summary', describes a distribution of data in five numbers.

1. sample minimum or smallest value
1. first (or lower) quartile.
1. median (or middle) value.
1. third (or upper) quartile.
1. sample maximum or largest value.


```{r summary_d}
summary(mpg$displ)
```


## visualise the entire distribution by creating a histogram using ggplot

```{r his_d}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x = displ)) + geom_histogram(col = "black")
```


# Comparing Variables

```{r com_v, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
 include_graphics("DATA_7201OL_categorical_quantitative.png")
```

As shown in the image above, and from the video on the previous page, we can see that for the following comparisons the plots are:

* Categorical versus categorical: bar charts
* Quantitative versus quantitative: scatterplots
* Quantitative versus categorical: box plots
* Categorical versus quantitative: box plots.

These suggestions are not the only possibilities, but are a good starting point.


# Categorical Versus Categorical

a categorical variable is a variable that consists of labels; 
e.g. colour of eyes. 
The various values that the label can take are often called the **levels** of the variable, in the eye colour case, the levels are:

blue
brown
hazel
green
grey
amber

```{r data_mpg}
library(tidyverse)
data(mpg)
mpg
```

So the two categorical variables that I am interested in are manufacturer and trans. From the figure, we see that manufacturer is on the x-axis and we have a bar chart.

```{r manufa_bar}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) + geom_bar()
```

now need to add the colour for the trans. As this is filling the rectangle, we call it fill.

 
```{r manufa_bar_fill}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, fill = trans)) + geom_bar()
```
 
This is not quite right. At the moment, for each manufacturer on the y-axis, we see the count for each transmission type. We want to convert this to a proportion to make it easier to compare.


 
```{r manufa_bar_f2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, fill = trans)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill", col = "black") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust=0))
``` 
 
Notice that the command position = "fill" does the job, I also added a colour = "black" to outline the rectangles. Finally, I rotated the x-axis labels.

# Quantitative Versus Quantitative

## Creating scatterplots

if there’s a relationship between a car’s engine size (the displ variable) and its fuel efficiency in the city (the cty variable, measured in miles per gallon). 

```{r displ_cty}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + geom_point()
``` 

As engine size increases, fuel efficiency decreases. 

# Interpreting Scatterplots

https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/67016/pages/week-4-interpreting-scatterplots?module_item_id=2284632


# Categorical Versus Quantitative

quantitative versus categorical variables with side-by-side boxplots.

Creating boxplots

So we start by setting the x-axis - manufacturer and the y-axis - displacement

```{r box_m_d}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, y = displ)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
``` 


```{r box_m_d_2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer, displ), 
                y = displ, 
                fill = manufacturer)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, hjust=0)) + 
  labs(x = "Manufacturer", y = "Displacement (litres)")
``` 

# Looking at Boxplots

https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/67016/pages/week-4-looking-at-boxplots?module_item_id=2284634

Load the mpg dataset.
What type of variable is drv

```{r mpg_data}
data(mpg)
mpg
``` 

Drive is a categorical nominal variable.

Produce an appropriate plot to look at it.

```{r drv_bar}
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) + geom_bar()
``` 

What type of variable is displ?

displ is a quantitative continuous variable.

Produce an appropriate plot to look at it.

```{r displ_his}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ)) + geom_histogram()
``` 

Finally produce a plot to compare displ to drv.

```{r dry_displ}
ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, displ)) + geom_boxplot()
``` 


Describe the relationship.


We see that front-wheel drive cars have on average lower displacement compared to 4-wheel drive cars, which are lower than rear-wheel drive. The spread (height of rectangles) is about the same for all drives, and there is one potential outlier for front-wheel drive at a value of 5.3 litres.
