sd(ashes_bind$scored,na.rm = TRUE)
```

test
```


**c. Bar chart**

      scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "black","darkgreen","grey"))+
      labs(title="Bar chart of teams participating in the series",x="Team")+
      theme_classic()
p2
```
```{r player}
t1 <- table(ashes_bind$team)/10
t1
```

13 players were used by Australia  team in the series;\
14 players were used by England   team in the series.

# Question Three: Scores for each team

**a. Histograms faceted by team**

```{r ashes_his_2}
p3 <- ggplot(ashes_bind, aes(x=scored, color=team, fill=team)) +
      geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.5)+
      scale_color_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00"))+
      scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "black"))+
      labs(title="Histogram of scores",x="Score")+
      facet_grid(team ~ .) +
      theme_classic()
p3
```


**b. Side-by-side boxplots**

```{r ashes_box}
p4 <- ggplot(ashes_bind, aes(x=scored, y = team, color=team, fill=team)) +
      geom_boxplot()+
      scale_color_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00"))+
      scale_fill_manual(values=c("navy", "black"))+
      labs(title="Side-by-side boxplots of scores",x="Score", y ="Team")+
      coord_flip()+
      theme_classic()
p4
```


**c. Average score**

```{r ashes_his_3}
library(plyr)
me <- ddply(ashes_bind, "team", summarise,
            grp.mean=mean(scored,na.rm = TRUE))
p3_1 <- ggplot(ashes_bind, aes(x=scored, color=team, fill=team)) +
        geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.5)+
        labs(title="Histogram of scores",x="Score")+
        facet_grid(team ~ .) +
        geom_vline(data=me, aes(xintercept=grp.mean),
             linetype="dashed")+
        scale_color_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00"))+
        scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "black"))+
        theme_classic()
p3_1
```

* From the Histogram of scores above, team Australia have had a higher average score.

* Side-by-side boxplots of scores above, team Australia have had a higher average score.

# Question Four: Scoring rates

**a. scatterplot **

```{r scatter}
p5 <- ggplot(ashes_bind, aes(x=number, y = scored, color=team, shape=team)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_color_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00"))+
      scale_fill_manual(values=c("navy", "black"))+
      labs(title="Scatterplot of scores against number of balls",
           x="Balls", y ="Scored")+
      geom_smooth(se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE)
      theme_classic()
p5
```

**b. relationship**

no relationship. Players who face more balls NOT likely to score more runs.


**c. scoring_rate**

```{r scoring_rate}
scoring_rate <-
  ashes_bind$number/ashes_bind$balls
p6 <- ggplot(ashes_bind, aes(x=number, y = scoring_rate, color=team, shape=team)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_color_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00"))+
      scale_fill_manual(values=c("navy", "black"))+
      labs(title="Scatterplot of scoring rate against number of balls",
           x="Balls", y ="scoring rate")+
      geom_smooth(se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE)
      theme_classic()
p6
```


**d. relationship between scoring rate and number of balls**

- Yes,there is a relationship between scoring rate and number of balls;\
  players who face more balls may likely to score runs more quickly.

# Question Five: Teamsâ€™ roles

**a. bar chart of the number of players on each team participating in the series**

```{r p2}
p2
```


**b. contingency table**



{r contingency table}
tablec <- ashes_bind%>%
            group_by(role, team)%>%
            summarize(n=n())%>%
            mutate(prop=n/sum(n))%>%
            subset(select=c("role","team","prop"))%>%
            spread(role, prop)%>%
            kable()
tablec
```

c

Aus team is made up of a larger proportion of batters\
England contains a larger proportion of all-rounders
